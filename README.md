This is the code repository for our work ``DRACO-DehazeNet: An Efficient Image Dehazing1 Network Combining Detail Recovery and a Novel2 Contrastive Learning Paradigm" by Gao Yu Lee, Tanmoy Dam, Md. Meftahul Ferdaus, Daniel Puiu Poenar, and Vu Duong, currently appeared as an ArXiV preprint.

**Abstract**: Image dehazing is crucial for clarifying images obscured by haze or fog, but current learning-based approaches is dependent on large volumes of training data and hence consumed significant computational power. Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent. Extensive tests on a variety of benchmarked haze datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

All codes that is and will be shown here are presented in Tensorflow Keras format.
